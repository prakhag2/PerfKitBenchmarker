# What is PerfKitBenchmarker?

PerfKitBenchmarker (PKB) is an <b>open source</b> benchmarking tool used to
measure and <b>compare cloud offerings</b>.  It is a community effort
involving over 500 participants including researchers, academic institutions
and companies together with the originator, Google. PKB reduces the complexity
in running benchmarks on supported cloud providers with unified and simple
commands. PKB measures the end to end time to provision resources in the cloud,
in addition to reporting on the most standard metrics of peak performance,
including: latency, throughput, time-to-complete, IOPS. PKB currently supports
eight cloud providers: Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services,
DigitalOcean, Microsoft Azure, Rackspace, Kubernetes, OpenStack, AliCloud and
local environment.
